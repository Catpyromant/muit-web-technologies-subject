        <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
        <p>
          We envision a world that works well. Where many disparate parts come
          together with energy, synergy, and synchronicity to form a more
          valuable, more connected, more innovative, and more rewarding whole.
          We believe that, while we can't create perfection, we can strive for
          it. While we can't make others accept new ideas, new processes, and
          new results, we can make it possible for people to see the benefits
          with greater clarity. We work, every day, toward making our vision a
          reality by never forgetting what it is, by keeping our mission and our
          values central to our core beliefs and work, and by remaining positive
          that we live in a world where ideas and people can, should, and must
          make a difference.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to change the world, and to help our clients change it.
          That's why "Change the world." is the default screen saver on Parallax
          computers. Why it's the large sculpture in the entryway of each of our
          offices. And why it's the theme line we use in all of our
          communications.
        </p>
        We know change is the new constant; it's all around us and dealing with
        it is challenging. We therefore strive to make it easier for our
        clients, partners and workforce to learn how to use various perspectives
        in observing, understanding and addressing it. Our way is not the only
        way. We recognize and respect different approaches to the same
        challenge.

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p>
          We accomplish our mission and fulfill our vision by adhering to our
          core values:
        </p>
        <img src="./public/team.jpg" />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Integrity: We adhere to the highest ethical standards: honesty and
            fairness are the foundations of our actions. We take pride in our
            honest dealing with others irrespective of nationality, culture or
            belief.
          </li>
          <li>
            Respect: We respect the rights, beliefs, and differences of our
            colleagues, our clients, our partners, and other citizens of the
            world. We treat others with care, dignity, equality and trust
          </li>
          <li>
            Accountability: We meet or exceed our commitments, and take
            responsibility for our performance in all of our decisions and
            actions. We remain accountable to our highest standards and to those
            who expect the best from us and who provide us with business.
          </li>
          <li>
            Innovation: We constantly look for and develop new ways to deliver
            value to our clients, our partners, and our global community. We
            look to the horizon and anticipate what new problems are coming, and
            what new solutions can be developed to meet them. We innovate in
            thought, in action and in finding ways to do things more
            effectively, more efficiently and more productively
          </li>
          <li>
            Teamwork: We work together in diverse and unified teams, at every
            level of the organization. We do that because we believe that
            teamwork is what makes us stronger. We help each other and by doing
            that help ourselves be better, stronger and united.
          </li>
