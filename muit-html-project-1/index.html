        <h1>Our Approach</h1>
        <p>
          One of the primary things that stand out about Parallax Global is our
          unique point-of-view and approach to consulting engagements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lens through which we view every consulting engagement is a
          Parallax View, which of course, as the definition of "parallax"
          suggests, means that we take two alternate (but not necessarily
          opposing) views of every problem, and compare and contrast two
          alternate strategies for approaching the problem. This ensures that
          individuals, teams and management do not become victims of their own
          paradigms (read Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
          for more on this), that we don't get lazy, and that we can assure our
          clients of the deepest and most creative approaches to their problems,
          every time.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>A Parallax Perspective</h2>
        <p>
          As we use the term, we mean taking a look at a task, assignment,
          problem from two different points-of-view. To do this, we assign two
          different teams to engage with an assignment and develop their own
          points of view, and then present their views to three referees, who
          then decide, based on the information that we have, which is the
          better initial path to pursue. But that is only the beginning of the
          process
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./public/perspective.jpg" />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Throughout the engagement, we continue to use both points of view as a
          way of illuminating the "space between them," and achieve greater
          clarity of observation and effectiveness of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, we protect ourselves from falling victim to reinforcing
          our own paradigms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modeled after the great Greek Philosophy, our Parallax view outlines
          two opposing approaches to the problems we try to collaborate with our
          clients and resolve. On one hand we use empiricism, viewing what we
          know from the physical (senses) perspective. We see, we feel, we
          acquire through being on the ground, talking to people, observing,
          touching others creations. On the other hand we use rationalism,
          thinking, reasoning, hypothesizing and abstracting on the way to
          determine possible courses of action. We also use ethics, the deep
          understanding of good and bad, right or wrong, just or not â€“ in short
          morality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our views, our processes and our protocols have been honed over and
          over again, with time, maturing and advancing over time, as we have
          grown as an organization. We share these with our people, we share it
          with our clients, and we share it with the world in our quest to
          Parallax things for the greater good
